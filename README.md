# How do each of the files in this repository contribute to the Shiny App?


### In Prep Data folder:

#### GEMM Data.xlsx
> This is the unedited GEMM dataset [found in the supplemental data of this NOAA report](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/72826). The GroundfishFilteringCode.R file reads in this dataset,
> particularly the catch and mortality data provided in "Table 3." Since the filtering code is based on this dataset, all subsequent
> GEMM datasets to be read into the filtering code and used in the Shiny App should be formatted in **the same way** (aka catch and
> mortality data on the third excel sheet with the table description taking up the first two rows of the sheet).

#### GroundfishFilteringCode.R
> This file filters the data for only federally managed species; the list of those species can be found in this code. This file also
> creates two combined fishery sector columns. One column is for slightly refined fishery sectors based on GEMM sector designation,
> the other is for higher level summary sectors. How the sectors are combined can be found be exploring this code or by viewing the
> Sector Groupings tab in the About section of the Shiny App itself. This file saves a new file named ShinyReadyData.csv that can be
> used in the Shiny App. The "Run Shiny" folder already has an accurate ShinyReadyData.csv as of July 2026. **However**, for each year
> that a new GEMM dataset is released, that new data will need to be fed into this file and the new ShinyReadyData.csv will need to
> replace the old one in the "Run Shiny" folder.


### In Run Shiny folder:

#### manifest.json
> This file is used exclusively to deploy the Shiny App to NOAA's Posit Connect. This manifest includes information like the content’s
> environment dependencies, and tells Connect how to deploy and host the app. **If any of the files or code in the Run Shiny folder are
> changed a new manifest must be created to reflect these changes**. This can be done by removing the current manifest.json and setting
> your R working directory to Run Shiny, and running the following code in your console: 
         rsconnect::writeManifest()

#### ui.R
> This is the user interface portion of the Shiny App. All formatting that the user sees is set up in this file including page titles,
> dropdown selections, where plots appear, etc.

#### server.R
> This is the server portion of the Shiny App. Any selections that the user makes via buttons or dropdowns on the app are taken as an
> input and the server gives the coded output. All code for plots and tables is written here using the ShinyReadyData.csv.

#### ShinyReadyData.csv
> This is the filtered GEMM data that is created by running original GEMM data through GroundfishFilteringCode.R. This file should be
> replaced each time an updated GEMM dataset is released with a new year of data so that the app stays up to date.

#### ShinyAboutPage.Rmd
> This file sets up the about page for the Shiny App. It is used by ui.R to place it in the user interface. This was placed in a separate
> file so as to not overcrowd the ui.R file. Each time the app is updated, the second to last line of code on this page should be updated
> to reflect the current date.
